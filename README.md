# Stiply openapi client generated by Maven

We have some issues when generating Stiply client code.

This project reproduces the issue.

Obtained contract from https://app.stiply.nl/v2/.metadata/openapi.json

Run with

    ./mvnw clean && ./mvnw package

This is expected to generate the client code but runs into openapi validation issues.
